# Operating-Systems-Project
This project provides a sophisticated File Management System in Java that mimics key features of contemporary operating systems. The main objective is to provide a system to facilitate secure file operations like creation, reading, writing, and deletion while including memory management, disk space monitoring, and concurrency control. The system supports role-based access by distinguishing between administrators and users, with secure login and registration functionality. For handling concurrent access, Java semaphores are employed to avoid race conditions in file operations, providing thread safety and integrity.

The project simulates disk space usage, tracking total, used, and available memory dynamically to prevent overflow while writing or creating files. The system also provides a file-sharing mechanism among users and imposes a constraint of five open files per user to simulate real OS constraints. A basic menu-based interface allows users to interact with the system, perform operations, and monitor system status. The project is a general simulation of file management systems in real operating environments with a focus on concurrency control, memory management, and secure user interaction. The project provides a good learning experience of how primary file operations and system-level features are implemented and controlled under operating systems
